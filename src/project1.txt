What bugs and conceptual difficulties did you encounter? How did you overcome them? What did you learn?
    The main bug I encountered was that my code would run infinitely. Turns out, I was checking the same couple
    nodes every single time, resulting in infinite debugging messages and no results. I had to add a tracker to
    store all the nodes I had already checked.
Describe whatever help (if any) that you received. Donâ€™t include readings, lectures, and exercises,
but do include any help from other sources, such as websites or people (including classmates and friends)
and attribute them by name.
    I had to resort to stack overflow for help overriding the equals() function. Here is the link I used
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6364258/override-equals-method

Describe any serious problems you encountered while writing the program.
    I didnt encounter any serious problems, rather smaller syntax and conceptual errors.

What did you use for your Part B heuristic?
    I used a straight line heuristic to avoid overestimation.

List any other feedback you have. Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the
assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
    I liked the real world application aspect of this project.
